  <h1>The Plant</h1>

  <span style='height: 91vh; margin: 1vmax; display: block; margin-bottom: 4vh;'>
  There in the sky, a soundless, colorless object. High  above any clouds, or planes, even the tallest of skyscrapers. Glinting in the sun’s golden rays. It had emerged from a distance. Each day it grew an inch bigger, a step closer. It threw the tides in disarray, it shot the moon out of orbit. No one knew what it was. Only after a month of floating in the sky did its intentions become clear. To grow. After taking samples of the object using drones, scientists found something surprising: it had cells. It was a giant ‘plant’ floating aimlessly from planet to planet, later we would learn that it puts down roots and takes all the water and nutrients from the host planet. Much was still not known. How it escaped gravity, how it even moved! Where did it come from was humanity’s greatest wonder. From the discovery of it being alive scientists already had a hint of its intentions. All living things need food or nutrients to stay alive. This ‘plant’ was no different. Only a couple months after these discoveries did we see how it got nutrients. In the sky small brown ‘straws’ were seen dropping, growing towards the ground. Eventually the ocean’s water levels started dropping. Every day another inch. At least the tsunamis from the ‘plant's’ gravity were getting weaker. Everyone put their minds together to find how to stop this apocalypse, to no avail. It had a protective layer that kept it safe from any attack, nuclear or otherwise. Earth was now out of its normal orbit. Extreme cold and heat ensued, that froze and evaporated all remaining water. Soon all the water had escaped the atmosphere or had been taken by the ‘plant’. No one could stop it. It eventually moved on.
